        <p>Another one. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. They don’t want us to eat. The key to more success is to get a massage once a week, very important, major key, cloth talk. Every chance I get, I water the plants, Lion! In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it. We don’t see them, we will never see them. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started.<br><br><br>It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up. They don’t want us to eat. Fan luv. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. Wraith talk. I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing.</p>
