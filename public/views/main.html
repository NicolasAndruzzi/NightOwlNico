        <p>I determine people's true, underlying needs and then deliver products and services that help them succeed through my understanding of people, technology, society, and business.</p>
        <h5>"Life is a mission, not a career. A career is a profession, a mission is a cause. A career asks, What's in it for me? A mission asks, How can I make a difference?"</h5>
